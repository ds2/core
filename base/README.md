# DS/2 OSS Core Base

This is the actual implementation runtime. It contains all the alternatives, cdi beans etc. to have the core base 
running.

Usually, you add this artifact in scope runtime:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>ds2.oss.core</groupId>
        <artifactId>ds2-oss-core-base</artifactId>
        <version>RELEASE</version>
        <scope>runtime</scope>
    </dependency>
